# Application Packaging Automation System (APAS) Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Intro

The Application Packaging Automation System (APAS) is an innovative AI-powered solution designed to revolutionize the application packaging workflow for enterprise deployment. APAS automates the time-consuming manual processes currently required to package applications using PowerShell AppDeploy Toolkit, create Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies, test deployments, and prepare applications for Intune deployment. By leveraging a collaborative multi-agent AI architecture, modern automation techniques, and a human-in-the-loop verification system with advanced visualization capabilities, APAS aims to dramatically reduce packaging time while maintaining high quality standards and security compliance.

## Initial Architect Prompt

### Technical Infrastructure

- **Collaborative Multi-Agent Architecture:** The system should be designed with a multi-agent architecture from the start, with clearly defined agent roles, communication protocols, and an orchestration layer. This should include:
  - **Specialist Agents:** Distinct AI agents for specific tasks (installer analysis, PSADT generation, WDAC policy creation)
  - **Orchestrator Agent:** Coordination layer that manages workflow and resolves conflicts
  - **Human Interface Agent:** Specialized in translating technical outputs to human-friendly explanations
  - **Communication Framework:** Well-defined protocol for inter-agent communication

- **Starter Project/Template:** No specific starter template required, but the system should be designed using modern software architecture principles with consideration for future expansion.

- **Hosting/Cloud Provider:** The MVP must run entirely on a single machine without requiring cloud resources. However, the architecture should be designed with future cloud integration in mind, potentially allowing for cloud-based processing in later versions.

- **Frontend Platform:** A local web application UI is recommended for the MVP, using modern web technologies (React/Angular/Vue) for the human oversight interface. This approach provides a familiar interface while maintaining the single-machine constraint. The interface should include advanced visualization components for explainable AI.

- **Backend Platform:** Python is recommended as the primary backend language due to its robust AI/ML libraries, integration capabilities with PowerShell, and cross-platform compatibility. Node.js could be considered as an alternative if stronger web integration is preferred.

- **Database Requirements:** A local SQLite database should be sufficient for the MVP to store metadata, package information, and system state. Consider document storage (e.g., MongoDB) for the knowledge base components if structured flexibility is needed.

- Test suite should include validation of generated PowerShell scripts and WDAC policies
- Simulated packaging workflows should be included for comprehensive testing
- The system should include a development mode for testing new components and features
- Command-line utilities should be provided for scripting and automation of system functions

### Other Technical Considerations

- AI model selection should balance accuracy with performance on local hardware
