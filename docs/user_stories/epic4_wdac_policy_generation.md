# Epic 4: WDAC Policy Generation & Testing

**Goal:** Implement automated creation, testing, and refinement of WDAC policies for packaged applications.

## Story List

### Story 4.1: WDAC Policy Generation Framework

- **User Story / Goal:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to generate baseline WDAC policies for applications that ensure proper functionality while maintaining security.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  The system creates baseline security policies that allow the application to run while maintaining system security. This is like having a security expert who knows exactly which doors should be unlocked for authorized visitors while keeping everything else secure. Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies control which applications and code can run on a computer, but creating these policies manually is complex and time-consuming. This automation ensures applications work correctly while maintaining strong security posturesâ€”getting this balance right is critical for enterprise environments.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement policy generation based on application analysis
  - Create template-based policy structure
  - Develop customization options for organization requirements
  - Implement policy validation against best practices
  - Create policy documentation generation
  - Support latest WDAC features including "App Control for Business"

- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: System generates valid WDAC policies for test applications
  - AC2: Policies follow template structure while incorporating application specifics
  - AC3: Organization requirements are properly reflected in policies
  - AC4: Validation identifies potential issues before deployment
  - AC5: Documentation clearly explains policy components and rationale

### Story 4.2: Application Code Signing Analysis

- **User Story / Goal:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to analyze application components for code signing to create accurate WDAC policies.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  The system analyzes how application components are digitally signed to create appropriate security rules. This is similar to verifying ID cards and credentials before granting access to a secure facility. Digital signatures verify the authenticity and integrity of software components, allowing the system to create rules based on trusted publishers rather than individual files. This approach is more maintainable and resilient to updates, as it will automatically trust new files from the same publisher. The system identifies all signed components, extracts certificate information, and creates appropriate rules.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement detection of signed executables and libraries
  - Create extraction of certificate information
  - Develop trust chain validation
  - Implement publisher rule generation
  - Create logging of signing analysis
  - Document analysis methodology and limitations

- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: System correctly identifies signed application components
  - AC2: Certificate information is accurately extracted
  - AC3: Trust chain validation correctly verifies certificates
  - AC4: Publisher rules reflect actual application signing
  - AC5: Logging provides clear information about signing status

### Story 4.3: WDAC Audit Mode Testing

- **User Story / Goal:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to test WDAC policies in audit mode to identify potential issues before enforcement.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  Security policies are tested in a monitoring mode that identifies potential issues without blocking anything. It's like having a security officer observe a new access control procedure without enforcing it yet, noting any problems that arise. This approach allows the system to see what would be blocked if the policy were enforced, without actually disrupting application functionality. By capturing these potential issues before enforcement, the system can refine the policies to ensure they will allow all legitimate application components to run while still maintaining security.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement deployment of policies in audit mode
  - Create execution of application installation and operation
  - Develop monitoring of code integrity events
  - Implement analysis of audit results
  - Create reporting of potential policy issues
  - Document testing methodology and interpretation of results

- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: System successfully deploys policies in audit mode
  - AC2: Application execution covers installation and normal operation
  - AC3: Monitoring captures all relevant code integrity events
  - AC4: Analysis correctly identifies policy gaps
  - AC5: Reporting clearly communicates issues requiring resolution

### Story 4.4: WDAC Policy Refinement

- **User Story / Goal:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to automatically refine WDAC policies based on audit testing results.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  Based on audit testing, the system automatically improves security policies to address any issues. This is like fine-tuning a security system after initial testing reveals potential vulnerabilities. The system analyzes code integrity violations (attempts to run code that would be blocked by the policy), determines what legitimate components were missed in the initial policy, and adds appropriate rules to allow those components. This iterative refinement process ensures the final policy will allow all required application functionality while maintaining the strongest possible security posture.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement analysis of code integrity violations
  - Create policy adjustments based on audit results
  - Develop iterative testing and refinement
  - Implement categorization of policy additions
  - Create documentation of refinement decisions
  - Document refinement methodology and limitations

- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: System correctly analyzes code integrity violations
  - AC2: Policy adjustments address identified issues
  - AC3: Iterative refinement eliminates false positives
  - AC4: Categorization provides context for policy additions
  - AC5: Documentation explains refinement decisions

### Story 4.5: WDAC Supplemental Policy Management

- **User Story / Goal:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to generate and manage supplemental WDAC policies for application-specific rules.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  The system creates and manages application-specific security policy additions that work alongside your organization's base policies. It's similar to having special access rules for specific contractors that supplement your standard building security policies. Base policies define organization-wide security rules, while supplemental policies contain application-specific exceptions. This approach maintains separation of concerns, making policies more manageable and reducing the risk of conflicts. The system handles the complex relationships between base and supplemental policies, ensuring they work together correctly.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement creation of application-specific supplemental policies
  - Create management of policy dependencies
  - Develop validation of compatibility with base policies
  - Implement versioning and updating of supplemental policies
  - Create documentation of policy relationships
  - Document management methodology and best practices

- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: System generates valid supplemental policies
  - AC2: Dependencies are properly managed and documented
  - AC3: Validation ensures compatibility with base policies
  - AC4: Versioning tracks policy changes effectively
  - AC5: Documentation clearly explains policy relationships

### Story 4.6: WDAC Enforcement Testing

- **User Story / Goal:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to test WDAC policies in enforcement mode to verify application functionality.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  The system tests security policies in enforcement mode to verify that applications function correctly while security is fully active. This is like doing a full dress rehearsal with all security measures active before opening day. While audit mode testing (Story 4.3) identifies what would be blocked, enforcement testing actually blocks unauthorized code to verify the application still functions correctly. This testing is critical to ensure that policies don't disrupt application functionality when deployed to production. The system executes the application with enforced policies, monitors behavior, and identifies any remaining issues.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement safe deployment of policies in enforcement mode
  - Create comprehensive application functionality testing
  - Develop monitoring of application behavior
  - Implement analysis of enforcement issues
  - Create rollback capability for problem policies
  - Document testing methodology and issue resolution

- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: System safely deploys policies in enforcement mode
  - AC2: Testing covers critical application functionality
  - AC3: Monitoring detects application behavior issues
  - AC4: Analysis correctly identifies enforcement problems
  - AC5: Rollback works reliably when needed

### Story 4.7: WDAC Policy Documentation Generation

- **User Story / Goal:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to generate comprehensive documentation for WDAC policies to support maintenance and troubleshooting.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  The system creates comprehensive documentation explaining the security policies, their purpose, and how they work. This is like having clearly written security procedures that explain not just the rules but the reasoning behind them. Good documentation is essential for ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting, especially for complex security policies that may be managed by different people over time. The generated documentation includes policy components, the reasoning behind decisions, visualizations of the policy structure, and troubleshooting guidanceâ€”everything needed to understand and maintain the policies.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement extraction of policy components and rules
  - Create documentation of policy decisions and rationale
  - Develop visualization of policy structure
  - Implement creation of troubleshooting guidance
  - Create policy comparison for version changes
  - Document generation methodology and customization

- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: Generated documentation includes all policy components
  - AC2: Decision rationale is clearly explained
  - AC3: Visualizations illustrate policy structure effectively
  - AC4: Troubleshooting guidance addresses common issues
  - AC5: Comparisons highlight changes between versions

### Story 4.8: WDAC Integration API

- **User Story / Goal:** As a developer, I need a well-defined API for WDAC policy management to enable integration with other system components.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  This creates a standardized way for other parts of the system to request and manage security policies. It functions similarly to the other APIs, providing a consistent interface for services. Like the installer analysis API (Story 2.8) and the PSADT integration API (Story 3.8), this API ensures all components can communicate with the policy generation engine in a consistent, reliable way. This standardization is crucial for maintaining a modular system where components can be updated or replaced without breaking the entire system.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement API for policy generation and management
  - Create structured response format for policies and test results
  - Develop status tracking for policy operations
  - Implement error handling and reporting
  - Create API documentation with examples
  - Document API performance characteristics and limitations

- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: API accepts policy requests with appropriate parameters
  - AC2: Responses provide complete policies and test results
  - AC3: Status tracking works for long-running operations
  - AC4: Error handling provides useful information for troubleshooting
  - AC5: Documentation enables developers to correctly use the API
