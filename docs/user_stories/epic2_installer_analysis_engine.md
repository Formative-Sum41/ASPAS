# Epic 2: Installer Analysis Engine Development

**Goal:** Create an intelligent system that accurately extracts metadata and installation requirements from application installers.

## Story List

### Story 2.1: Installer File Type Detection and Classification

- **User Story / Goal:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to automatically detect and classify installer file types to determine appropriate analysis methods.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  This is teaching the system to recognize different types of installation files, just like you might recognize the difference between a PDF and a Word document. The system learns to identify MSI installers, EXE installers, MSIX packages, and other formats, which is crucial because each type needs to be handled differently. It's like training someone to identify different types of vehicles (cars, trucks, motorcycles) so they know which driving rules apply to each one. This capability forms the foundation for all the analysis that follows.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement detection for common installer types (MSI, EXE, MSIX, AppX, etc.)
  - Create classification system for different installer technologies
  - Develop identification of installation frameworks (InstallShield, NSIS, Inno, etc.)
  - Implement version detection for installer technologies
  - Create logging of detection processes and results
  - Document detection methodologies and accuracy metrics

- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: System correctly identifies at least 95% of common installer types
  - AC2: Classification accuracy is verified against known installer samples
  - AC3: Installer framework detection works for major packaging technologies

### Story 2.2: Installer Metadata Extraction

- **User Story / Goal:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to automatically extract key metadata from installers to populate packaging information.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  Here the system learns to extract important information from installers: the application name, version, publisher, what kind of computer it runs on, and other critical details. It's like teaching someone to read the important parts of a book's cover and table of contents to understand what's inside. This automation saves packaging engineers from having to manually look up this information and reduces the chance of errors in the packaging process. It's similar to how a scanner might extract text from a document so you don't have to type it all in manually.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement extraction of product name, version, publisher
  - Create detection of installation requirements
  - Develop identification of target architecture (x86, x64, ARM)

### Story 2.3: Installation Command Analysis

- **User Story / Goal:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to determine the correct installation commands and parameters for silent installation.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  The system learns to determine the right commands to install software silently (without requiring user interaction). This is like figuring out the exact instructions needed to assemble furniture without having to ask questions along the way. For packaging engineers, this eliminates one of the most time-consuming aspects of their job: researching and testing different installation commands to find the one that works correctly without user intervention. It's similar to having an assistant who knows exactly what buttons to press to program your new TV without needing to consult the manual.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement detection of standard silent installation switches
  - Create analysis of installer-specific parameters
  - Develop detection of customization options
  - Implement identification of required vs. optional parameters
  - Create logging of command analysis process

### Story 2.4: AI-Powered Installation Requirements Analysis

- **User Story / Goal:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to use AI to determine installation requirements not explicitly stated in the installer.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  This is where advanced AI helps figure out requirements that aren't explicitly stated in the installer. For example, the AI might recognize that a certain application requires the .NET Framework even if the installer doesn't clearly say so. It's like an experienced mechanic who knows a car needs transmission fluid based on other symptoms, even if that wasn't the original complaint. This feature dramatically improves packaging accuracy by identifying requirements that might otherwise be missed, preventing deployment failures in production environments.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement AI analysis of installer contents
  - Create identification of prerequisite software
  - Develop detection of runtime requirements
  - Implement analysis of system compatibility
  - Create confidence scoring for AI predictions
  - Document AI analysis methodologies and limitations
  - Integrate with knowledge base for requirement learning

- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: AI correctly identifies unstated prerequisites for 85%+ of complex installers
  - AC2: Runtime requirements are accurately detected
  - AC3: Compatibility analysis correctly flags potential issues
  - AC4: Confidence scores correlate with prediction accuracy
  - AC5: System improves predictions based on feedback

### Story 2.5: Installer Content Inventory

- **User Story / Goal:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to create an inventory of installer contents to understand what will be deployed.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  The system analyzes what's inside the installer packageâ€”all the files, components, and resources. This is like unpacking a moving box to create an inventory of everything inside, so you know exactly what you're working with. For packaging engineers, this provides critical visibility into what the application will actually install, helping identify potential security concerns or compatibility issues before deployment. It's similar to checking the ingredient list on food packaging so you know exactly what you're putting into your body.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement extraction and analysis of embedded files
  - Create identification of key executable files
  - Develop detection of drivers and system components
  - Implement identification of potential security concerns
  - Create content classification and tagging

### Story 2.6: External Research Integration

- **User Story / Goal:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to automatically research applications online to find installation information not available in the installer.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  When the installer doesn't provide enough information, the system can research online to find additional details about how to properly package the application. It's like consulting user manuals, forums, and expert advice when the instructions that came with a product are insufficient. This capability is particularly valuable for complex or poorly documented applications, as it can find installation parameters, requirements, and troubleshooting tips that would otherwise require extensive manual research by packaging engineers.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement search capabilities for installation documentation
  - Create identification of relevant information sources
  - Develop extraction of installation parameters from documentation
  - Implement verification of found information
  - Create confidence scoring for external information

### Story 2.7: Analysis Results Integration

- **User Story / Goal:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to combine and prioritize all analysis results to provide clear installation guidance.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  All the information gathered from different sources gets combined into a clear set of instructions for packaging the application. The system resolves any conflicts (like contradictory information) and prioritizes the most reliable sources. This is similar to a researcher reviewing multiple studies and creating a comprehensive summary of the findings. For packaging engineers, this final integration step transforms raw analysis into actionable packaging instructions, saving them from having to manually collate and interpret various pieces of information.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement consolidation of metadata from multiple sources
  - Create prioritization of conflicting information
  - Develop confidence scoring for final recommendations
  - Implement generation of installation guidance

### Story 2.8: Analysis Engine API

- **User Story / Goal:** As a developer, I need a well-defined API for the installer analysis engine to enable integration with other system components.

- **Non-Technical Explanation:**  
  This creates a standardized way for other parts of the system to request and receive installer analysis results. It's like establishing a standard form that different departments use to request information from the research team. The API ensures that all componentsâ€”from the user interface to the script generation engine to the security policy creatorâ€”can communicate with the analysis engine in a consistent, reliable way. This standardization is crucial for maintaining a modular system where components can be updated or replaced without breaking the entire system.

- **Detailed Requirements:**
  - Implement RESTful API for analysis requests
  - Create structured response format for analysis results
  - Develop status tracking for long-running analyses
  - Implement error handling and reporting
  - Create API documentation with examples
  - Document API performance characteristics and limitations

- **Acceptance Criteria (ACs):**
  - AC1: API accepts analysis requests with appropriate parameters
  - AC2: Responses provide complete analysis results in structured format
  - AC3: Status tracking works for analyses of varying duration
  - AC4: Error handling provides useful information for troubleshooting
  - AC5: Documentation enables developers to correctly use the API
