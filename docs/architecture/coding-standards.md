# Application Packaging Automation System (APAS) Coding Standards and Patterns

## Architectural / Design Patterns Adopted

- **Modular Microkernel Architecture**: The system is built around a lean orchestration core with specialized agents as loadable modules, enabling component isolation, parallel operation, and selective updating.
  - _Rationale:_ This approach enables true specialization of AI components, isolation of failures, and easier maintenance/extension.

- **Event-Driven Communication**: All system components communicate through a central event bus using a publish-subscribe pattern, enabling loose coupling, workflow flexibility, and observability.
  - _Rationale:_ Asynchronous communication promotes decoupling, supports complex workflows, and provides natural event trails for explainability.

- **Mediator Pattern (in Orchestration Core)**: The orchestration core acts as a mediator between agents, coordinating complex workflows and resolving conflicts.
  - _Rationale:_ Centralizes coordination logic and decision making when different AI agents have competing recommendations.

- **Repository Pattern**: Data access is encapsulated behind repository interfaces to abstract database operations.
  - _Rationale:_ Provides a clean separation between data access and business logic.

- **Dependency Injection**: Components receive their dependencies rather than creating them directly.
  - _Rationale:_ Improves testability and modularity by reducing tight coupling.

- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating agent instances with appropriate configurations.
  - _Rationale:_ Centralizes complex object creation logic.

- **Observer Pattern**: Implemented through the event bus for notification of state changes.
  - _Rationale:_ Enables loose coupling while maintaining synchronization between components.

- **Strategy Pattern**: Used for implementing different agent behaviors and decision strategies.
  - _Rationale:_ Allows for runtime selection of appropriate algorithms and behaviors.

    - Files: `Verb-Noun.ps1`

- **File Structure**:
  - Adhere to the layout defined in `docs/architecture/project-structure.md`
  - Each module should have an `__init__.py` that defines its public API
  - React components should be in their own directories with index files

- **Asynchronous Operations**:
  - **Python**: Use `async`/`await` for I/O-bound operations
  - **TypeScript**: Use `async`/`await` for asynchronous operations
  - **Event Bus**: Always use asynchronous event handlers

- **Type Safety**:
  - **Python**: Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
    - Use `Optional` for optional parameters
    - Use `Union` for values that could be different types
    - Use `TypeVar` for generic typing
  - **TypeScript**: Use strict mode with explicit types
    - Avoid `any` type except when absolutely necessary
    - Use interfaces for object shapes
    - Use generics for reusable components
  - **Type Definitions**: Centralized in `types.py` or `types.ts` files

- **Comments & Documentation**:
  - All public functions and classes must have docstrings/JSDoc comments
  - Complex logic should have inline comments explaining the approach
  - Use TODO or FIXME comments for temporary or upcoming work
  - Update relevant documentation when making significant changes

- **Dependency Management**:
  - **Python**: Poetry for dependency management
  - **TypeScript**: npm/yarn with package.json
  - Minimize external dependencies, favor well-maintained libraries
  - Lock dependency versions for reproducible builds

## Error Handling Strategy

- **General Approach**:
  - Use structured error handling with specific exception types
  - Fail fast when encountering critical errors
  - Provide detailed error messages for troubleshooting
  - Log all errors with appropriate context

- **Logging**:
  - **Library/Method**: 
    - Python: Use the standard `logging` module
    - TypeScript: Use a custom logger wrapping `console`
  - **Format**: Structured JSON for machine parsing
  - **Levels**:
    - DEBUG: Detailed information for debugging
    - INFO: General information about system operation
    - WARNING: Potential issues that don't prevent operation
    - ERROR: Issues that prevent a specific operation
    - CRITICAL: Issues that prevent system operation
  - **Context**: Include relevant identifiers (request ID, user ID, etc.), timestamp, and operation details

- **Specific Handling Patterns**:
  - **External API Calls**:
    - Use timeouts for all external calls
    - Implement retries with exponential backoff for transient errors
    - Circuit breaking for failing dependencies
    - Validate responses before processing
  - **Input Validation**:
    - Validate input at API boundaries using Pydantic/Zod
    - Perform additional domain-specific validation in services
    - Return detailed validation errors to callers
  - **AI Model Operations**:
    - Handle model loading failures gracefully
    - Implement fallbacks for model inference errors
    - Set appropriate confidence thresholds
  - **Graceful Degradation vs. Critical Failure**:
    - Continue with reduced functionality for non-critical components
    - Fail immediately for data integrity issues
    - Present clear error messages to users through the UI

## Security Best Practices

- **Input Sanitization/Validation**:
  - Always validate and sanitize inputs at API boundaries
  - Use parameterized queries for database operations
  - Sanitize inputs before passing to PowerShell
  - Validate file content before processing

- **Installer Handling**:
  - Run all installer analysis in a controlled environment
  - Validate installers before processing
  - Limit execution capabilities to necessary operations
  - Implement safeguards against malicious installers

## Agent Development Standards
