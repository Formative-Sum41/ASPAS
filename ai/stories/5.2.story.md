# Story 5.2: Interactive Decision Tree Visualization

**Status:** Draft

## Non-Technical Explanation

In this story, we're creating the system's ability to show packaging engineers how the AI made its decisions. Imagine if you used a GPS navigation app, but instead of just giving you directions, it also showed you why it chose a particular routeâ€”displaying the factors it considered like traffic conditions, distance, and road closures, and how each affected the final route recommendation.

Similarly, our interactive decision tree visualization will show the step-by-step reasoning process the AI went through when making packaging decisions. Engineers will see a tree-like structure where each node represents a decision point, like "What type of installer is this?" or "Which installation parameters should be used?" Users can click on different parts of the tree to expand them and see more detailed information about specific decisions.

This transparency is crucial because it allows packaging engineers to understand why the AI system made certain choices, building trust in the automation process. It also helps identify points where the system's reasoning might be incorrect, allowing for more precise human intervention when needed. Rather than just seeing the end result of what the AI decided, engineers get visibility into the entire decision-making journey.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a packaging engineer, I need interactive decision tree visualizations to understand the AI's reasoning process for packaging decisions.

**Context:** Building on the dashboard foundation (Story 5.1), this story implements the interactive decision tree visualization component that will show how the AI agents made decisions throughout the packaging process. This is a key component of the explainable AI approach that builds trust in the system.

## Detailed Requirements

- Design interactive decision tree visualization components
- Implement collapsible/expandable decision nodes for managing complexity
- Create highlighting for critical decision points
- Develop visualization of decision weights and importance factors
- Implement zoom and navigation controls for large decision trees
- Create export functionality for decision trees
- Document visualization interaction patterns and interpretation

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Decision trees accurately reflect the AI agents' actual decision-making process
- AC2: Interactive elements work properly (expand/collapse, navigation, highlighting)
- AC3: Visual design clearly communicates decision hierarchy and importance
- AC4: Large decision trees remain navigable and understandable
- AC5: Exported visualizations maintain all necessary context

1. **Accessing the Decision Tree**:
   - Open the application and navigate to the Dashboard
   - Select an existing packaging task
   - In the task detail view, select the "Decisions" tab
   - Verify that the decision tree loads and displays correctly

2. **Interacting with the Tree**:
   - Click on different nodes to see their details displayed
   - Try expanding collapsed nodes by clicking the expand icon
   - Try collapsing expanded branches using the collapse icon

3. **Navigating Large Trees**:
   - Use the zoom controls to zoom in and out of the tree
   - Try panning around the tree by clicking and dragging
   - Use the minimap (if available) to navigate to different parts of the tree
   - Verify that you can effectively navigate even complex decision trees

4. **Examining Decision Details**:
   - Hover over nodes to see tooltips with additional information
   - Click on a node to select it and view its details in the detail panel
   - Check that the detail panel shows reasoning, confidence, and other relevant information
   - Verify that evidence and alternatives are displayed when available

5. **Using Search and Filters**:
   - Try searching for specific terms within the decision tree
   - Use the filter controls to show only certain types of nodes
   - Try filtering by confidence level
   - Verify that the search and filter functions work correctly

6. **Exporting the Visualization**:
