# Story 5.1: Dashboard Development

**Status:** Draft

## Non-Technical Explanation

In this story, we'll be creating a central dashboard that serves as the main control center for the Application Packaging Automation System. Think of this like an air traffic control center, where packaging engineers can monitor all the ongoing packaging tasks in one place.

The dashboard provides a comprehensive view of all packaging tasks currently in the system - showing which applications are being processed, what stage they're at, whether there are any issues requiring attention, and key performance metrics about the system as a whole. 

Just like how a pilot uses a cockpit dashboard to understand the status of different aircraft systems at a glance, this dashboard allows packaging engineers to quickly understand what's happening with all packaging tasks and take appropriate action when needed. It provides filtering and sorting capabilities so engineers can focus on specific tasks (such as those that need attention), and offers detailed views when they need to dive deeper into a specific application's packaging process.

This dashboard is the first component of the human oversight interface, and forms the foundation that all other visualization and interaction features will build upon in subsequent stories.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a packaging engineer, I need a comprehensive dashboard to monitor and manage automated packaging processes.

**Context:** This story is the first in Epic 5 (Human Oversight Interface) and provides the foundational user interface that all subsequent visualization and interaction capabilities will build upon. It creates the central dashboard where packaging engineers will manage and monitor the automated packaging system.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement dashboard with overview of all packaging tasks
- Create status visualization for different process stages
- Develop filtering and sorting of packaging tasks
- Implement detailed view for individual processes
- Create performance metrics visualization
- Document dashboard functionality and navigation

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Dashboard displays all current packaging tasks with status
- AC2: Visualization clearly shows process stages and progress
- AC3: Filtering and sorting work correctly for task management
- AC4: Detailed view provides comprehensive process information
- AC5: Performance metrics provide useful operational insights

  - _(Hint: See `docs/APAS_UI_UX_Specification.md` for design details)_

- **Data Structures:**

  - `Task` schema for packaging tasks:
    ```typescript
    interface Task {
      id: string;
      name: string;
      status: 'pending' | 'in-progress' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'needs-review';
      applicationName: string;
      applicationVersion: string;
      stage: 'analysis' | 'psadt-generation' | 'wdac-policy' | 'testing' | 'documentation';
      progress: number; // 0-100
      createdAt: string;
      updatedAt: string;
      assignedTo?: string;
      priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    }
    ```
  - `Metrics` schema for system metrics:
    ```typescript
    interface Metrics {
      totalTasks: number;
      completedTasks: number;
      tasksNeedingReview: number;
      averageCompletionTime: number; // in minutes
      successRate: number; // percentage
      tasksByStatus: Record<string, number>;
      tasksByStage: Record<string, number>;
    }
    ```
  - _(Hint: See `docs/architecture/data-models.md` for structure details)_

- **Environment Variables:**

  - `VITE_API_BASE_URL` - Base URL for API requests (frontend)
  - `VITE_WS_BASE_URL` - Base URL for WebSocket connections (frontend)
  - `DASHBOARD_REFRESH_INTERVAL` - Polling interval for dashboard updates
  - _(Hint: See `docs/architecture/environment-vars.md` for details)_

- **Coding Standards Notes:**
  - Use functional components with hooks for React components
  - Implement proper error handling and loading states
  - Use Typescript interfaces for all data structures
  - Follow responsive design best practices
  - Implement proper accessibility for all UI components
  - _(Hint: See `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` for full standards)_

## Manual Testing Guide (For Non-Technical Users)

You can verify the dashboard is working correctly through these steps:

1. **Accessing the Dashboard**:
   - Open the application in your browser
   - Navigate to the Dashboard page using the sidebar menu
   - Verify that the dashboard loads with the metrics display and task list

2. **Viewing Task Information**:
   - Check that the task list shows all current packaging tasks
   - Verify that each task shows the correct status and stage
   - Check that the progress visualization accurately reflects the task status

3. **Filtering and Sorting**:
   - Try filtering tasks by status (e.g., only show "In Progress" tasks)
   - Try filtering tasks by application name or other properties
   - Try sorting tasks by different criteria (e.g., creation date, priority)
   - Verify that the filtering and sorting controls work correctly

4. **Viewing Task Details**:
   - Click on a task in the list to view its details
   - Verify that the detailed view shows comprehensive information about the task
   - Check that you can navigate between different tabs in the detail view
   - Verify that any actions available in the detail view work correctly

5. **Checking Metrics**:
   - Verify that the metrics display shows relevant information
   - Check that the charts and visualizations render correctly
   - Verify that the metrics update when the dashboard data refreshes

6. **Testing Responsiveness**:
   - Try viewing the dashboard on different devices or at different browser window sizes
   - Verify that the layout adjusts appropriately for different screen sizes
