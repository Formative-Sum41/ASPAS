# Story 5.5: Process Monitoring Interface

**Status:** Draft

## Non-Technical Explanation

This story focuses on creating a detailed monitoring interface that shows packaging engineers exactly what's happening during automated packaging processes. 

Think of it like a cockpit view in a flight simulator, where you can see all the gauges, indicators, and system statuses in real-time. Instead of just seeing a progress bar moving from 0% to 100%, you'll be able to see each step of the process as it happensâ€”the installer being analyzed, decisions being made about installation parameters, PowerShell scripts being generated, WDAC policies being created and tested, and more.

What makes this monitoring interface special is that it doesn't just show what's happening, but also why. When the system decides to use a particular installation parameter, you'll see the reasoning behind that decision. When it detects a potential issue, you'll see what factors triggered the warning. This transparency helps packaging engineers understand and trust the automation process.

The interface also includes comprehensive logging with context, so you can review what happened at each stage and understand the decision-making process. This is particularly valuable for debugging issues or understanding why the system took a certain approach. It's like having a detailed flight recorder that captures not just what happened but the reasoning behind each action.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a packaging engineer, I need detailed monitoring capabilities for automated processes with explainable visualizations to understand system operations.

**Context:** Building on the dashboard (Story 5.1) and visualization components (Stories 5.2-5.4), this story creates a detailed process monitoring interface that shows real-time progress of packaging operations along with explainable visualizations of the system's decision-making process.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement real-time process monitoring views
- Create interactive visualization of process steps and stages
- Develop explainable display of critical decision points
- Implement log viewing and filtering with decision context
- Create alerting for process issues with explanation of causes
- Integrate decision visualization with process monitoring
- Document monitoring capabilities and interpretation

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Monitoring view shows real-time process information with decision context
- AC2: Visualization clearly illustrates process flow and reasoning
- AC3: Decision points are highlighted with interactive explanations
- AC4: Log viewing provides filtered access to process details with decision context
- AC5: Alerts effectively notify of important issues with clear explanations

## Manual Testing Guide (For Non-Technical Users)

You can verify the process monitoring interface through these steps:

1. **Accessing the Monitoring Interface**:
   - Open the application and navigate to the Dashboard
   - Select an active packaging task
   - In the task detail view, select the "Monitoring" tab
   - Verify that the monitoring interface loads with the current process state

2. **Viewing Process Flow**:
   - Check that the process flow visualization shows the overall packaging process
   - Verify that the current stage and step are clearly highlighted
   - Watch for real-time updates as the process progresses
   - Try interacting with different stages and steps to see more information

3. **Exploring Decision Points**:
   - Look for decision point indicators in the process flow
   - Click on a decision point to see detailed information
   - Verify that the decision explanation is clear and understandable
   - Check that you can see the factors that influenced the decision

4. **Viewing Logs**:
   - Check that the log viewer shows process logs with appropriate detail
   - Try filtering logs by level (debug, info, warning, error)
   - Try filtering logs by stage or agent
   - Search for specific terms in the logs
   - Click on a log entry to see more details
   - Verify that decision-related logs link to the relevant decision points

5. **Handling Alerts**:
   - If any alerts are present, check that they are clearly displayed
   - Verify that alert information includes useful explanation of the issue
   - Try acknowledging an alert if that functionality is available
   - Check that alerts with different severity levels are appropriately distinguished

6. **Testing Real-Time Updates**:
   - Watch the interface as the process progresses
   - Verify that updates appear in real-time without requiring manual refresh
   - Check that the progress indicators update correctly
   - Verify that completed steps are marked appropriately
