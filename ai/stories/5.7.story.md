# Story 5.7: Approval Workflow with Decision Validation

**Status:** Draft

## Non-Technical Explanation

This story focuses on creating a structured process for packaging engineers to review and approve the final results of automated packaging before they're deployed to production systems.

Think of it like a quality control checkpoint at the end of a manufacturing process. Even though automated systems have done most of the work, a human expert reviews the final product to ensure everything meets standards before it goes out the door. Unlike ad-hoc interventions (which happen during the process when the system encounters uncertainty), this approval workflow is a deliberate, consistent review step that happens for every package.

The approval workflow will guide engineers through reviewing each aspect of the package—the installer analysis, the deployment script, the security policy, and the documentation—with visualizations showing how the system made decisions for each component. The workflow will highlight key points that need validation, show confidence levels for various aspects, and provide context to help engineers make informed decisions.

For example, the system might highlight that it's highly confident about the installation parameters but less certain about a security policy exception, helping the engineer focus their attention where human judgment is most valuable. When engineers approve or modify a component, the system tracks those decisions with the context, creating an audit trail of the approval process.

This structured approach ensures thorough validation while making the process as efficient as possible—helping engineers focus on the aspects that matter most rather than manually reviewing every detail.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a packaging engineer, I need a structured approval workflow with clear visualization of AI decisions to effectively validate packaging results.

**Context:** Building on the dashboard (Story 5.1), decision visualization (Stories 5.2-5.4), and intervention capabilities (Story 5.6), this story implements a structured approval workflow for validating completed packaging tasks before deployment. This ensures human oversight of the final results while maintaining efficiency.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement multi-stage approval process with decision context for each stage
- Create review interfaces with interactive decision visualization
- Develop approval validation with confidence indicators
- Implement tracking of approval decisions with decision context
- Create documentation of approval history with decision rationale
- Document workflow stages and decision validation requirements

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Approval process covers all critical packaging components with decision visualization
- AC2: Review interfaces provide interactive decision context for informed decisions
- AC3: Validation ensures all requirements are met with confidence indicators
- AC4: Tracking maintains complete audit trail of approvals with decision context
- AC5: Documentation provides visual context for approval decisions

## Manual Testing Guide (For Non-Technical Users)

You can verify the approval workflow with decision validation through these steps:

1. **Accessing the Approval Workflow**:
   - Open the application and navigate to the Dashboard
   - Find a task that is ready for approval (it should have a status indicator showing this)
   - Click on the task to open its details
   - Select the "Approval" tab
   - Verify that the approval workflow interface loads correctly

2. **Navigating the Workflow**:
   - Check that the workflow shows all required approval stages
   - Verify that stages are clearly labeled and their status is indicated
   - Try navigating between different stages
   - Confirm that the current stage is highlighted
   - Check that completed stages show their approval status

3. **Reviewing Components**:
   - Select a stage to review
   - Check that you can see a preview of the component being reviewed
   - Verify that decision context is provided to help understand how the component was created
   - Try exploring different review areas within the component
   - Confirm that areas with low confidence or potential issues are highlighted

4. **Checking Validation Results**:
   - Look for the validation results section
   - Check that validation checks are clearly listed with their status
   - Try viewing details for any failed or warning validations
   - Verify that severity levels are indicated for issues
   - Confirm that any critical issues are prominently displayed

5. **Making Approval Decisions**:
   - After reviewing a stage, try making an approval decision
   - Verify that you can choose between approve, reject, or approve with changes
   - If approving with changes, try specifying the changes
   - Add comments explaining your decision
   - Submit the approval decision
   - Verify that the stage status updates correctly

6. **Viewing Approval History**:
   - Navigate to the approval history section if available
   - Check that previous approval decisions are recorded
   - Verify that the history shows who made each decision and when
   - Try viewing the details of a previous decision
   - Confirm that any changes or comments are displayed

7. **Completing the Workflow**:
   - Work through all stages of the approval workflow
   - After approving all stages, check if a final approval step is presented
   - Complete the final approval if applicable
   - Verify that the task status changes to reflect the completed approval
   - Confirm that the approved package is available for deployment

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** 
  - Test validation rule execution
  - Test approval workflow state management

  - Test approval form validation
  - Verify history tracking functions

- **Integration Tests:** 
  - Test end-to-end approval workflow
  - Test validation across different components
  - Test approval submission and state changes
  - Verify integration with decision visualization
  - Test history recording and retrieval

- **Manual Verification:**
