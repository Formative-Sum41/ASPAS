# Story 1.4: Multi-Agent AI Framework

**Status:** Draft

## Non-Technical Explanation

Think of this story as building the actual infrastructure that allows our team of AI specialists to work together. It's like creating an office building with not just the physical spaces (cubicles, meeting rooms), but also the communication systems (phones, email, messaging), management structure (reporting lines, project assignments), and coordination tools (project tracking boards, scheduling systems).

This framework is what allows our different AI experts to:
- Know their specific jobs and responsibilities
- Communicate with each other to share information
- Coordinate their activities on complex tasks
- Hand off work from one specialist to another
- Resolve disagreements when they have different opinions
- Track progress across the entire workflow

## Why This Matters

This is where we transition from design to actual implementation. Without this framework, our AI specialists would just be individual tools with no way to work together. The framework is what turns separate specialists into a coordinated team that can handle complex tasks through collaboration.

Just as a hospital needs systems to coordinate between doctors, nurses, specialists, and administrative staff to provide complete patient care, our application packaging system needs this framework to coordinate between different AI specialists to deliver complete package solutions.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I need a framework for creating, coordinating, and managing specialized AI agents within the APAS system.

**Context:** Building on the architectural design (Story 1.1), development environment (Story 1.2), and database schema (Story 1.3), this story implements the core multi-agent framework that will power the APAS system. This framework will enable specialized agents to work together effectively through a well-defined orchestration layer.

## Detailed Requirements

- Design a modular framework for creating specialized AI agents
- Implement agent lifecycle management (creation, monitoring, termination)
- Create standardized interfaces for different agent types
- Develop inter-agent communication mechanisms
- Implement agent coordination and orchestration
- Create monitoring and observability for agent activities
- Support different AI model types for different agent specializations
- Document agent framework architecture and extension patterns

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Framework successfully creates and manages specialized agents
- AC2: Agents communicate effectively using the established protocol
- AC3: Orchestration layer properly coordinates workflow between agents
- AC4: Monitoring provides visibility into agent activities
- AC5: Documentation clearly explains how to create new agent types
- AC6: Framework supports both synchronous and asynchronous agent operations

```

The framework will use the mediator pattern with the Orchestration Core acting as the coordinator between specialized agents. The Event Bus provides asynchronous communication, while the State Manager maintains the workflow state and the Conflict Resolver handles competing recommendations.

## Manual Testing Guide (For Non-Technical Users)

While this is a primarily technical story, there are aspects you can verify to ensure the multi-agent framework is working correctly:

1. **Framework Demonstration**:
   - Ask for a demonstration of multiple AI agents working together on a simple task
   - Verify that you can see the different specialized agents involved
   - Observe how information flows between agents
   - Check that the orchestration layer is controlling the workflow

2. **Interface Review**:
   - Review the monitoring interface that shows agent activities
   - Verify that you can see what each agent is doing
   - Check that the status of the overall workflow is visible
   - Confirm that any issues or conflicts are clearly highlighted

3. **Communication Test**:
   - Ask to see a demonstration of agents communicating with each other
   - Verify that messages are properly sent and received
   - Check that the event bus is correctly routing messages
   - Confirm that message history is recorded for troubleshooting

4. **Expected Results**:
   - You should be able to see multiple agents working together on a task
   - The orchestration layer should clearly control the workflow
   - Communication between agents should be visible and traceable
   - The system should handle both simple and complex workflows

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** 
  - Test base agent functionality
  - Verify event bus messaging

  - Verify state tracking functionality

- **Integration Tests:** 
  - Test end-to-end workflows with sample agents
  - Verify cross-agent communication
  - Test orchestration with multiple concurrent workflows
  - Validate state persistence across operations
  - Test monitoring and observability features

- **Manual Verification:** 
  - Review framework documentation for clarity
  - Verify that a new agent can be created following the documentation

  - Check that monitoring provides useful visibility
  - Validate that orchestration correctly manages agent workflows

## AI Dev Agent Implementation Notes

- Use the mediator pattern for the orchestration implementation to decouple agents
- Implement both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns
- Consider using an in-memory event bus for development with the option to switch to a persistent event bus for production
- Use dependency injection for services to make testing easier
- Implement proper error handling with meaningful error messages
- Ensure the system can recover from agent failures
- The event message structure should include correlation IDs for tracing related messages
- Implement a time-based message expiration mechanism for the event bus
- Create a simple agent implementation for testing that doesn't require complex AI models
- Use Pydantic for agent configuration validation

## Implementation Example

Here's an example of how the event message structure might be implemented:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Dict, Any, Optional, List
from datetime import datetime
import uuid

class EventMessage(BaseModel):
    """
    Standard message format for inter-agent communication.
    """
    id: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))
    topic: str
    source_agent: str
    target_agent: Optional[str] = None  # None means broadcast
    correlation_id: Optional[str] = None
    reply_to: Optional[str] = None
    timestamp: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
    payload: Dict[str, Any]
    metadata: Dict[str, Any] = Field(default_factory=dict)
    
    class Config:
        schema_extra = {
            "example": {
                "id": "msg-123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
                "topic": "installer.analysis.complete",
                "source_agent": "installer-analyzer",
                "target_agent": "psadt-generator",
                "correlation_id": "task-123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
                "reply_to": None,
                "timestamp": "2025-05-08T10:30:15.123456",
                "payload": {
                    "installer_id": "inst-123",
                    "analysis_results": {
                        "installer_type": "msi",
                        "silent_params": "/quiet /norestart"
                    }
                },
                "metadata": {
                    "priority": "high",
                    "retry_count": 0
                }
            }
        }
```
