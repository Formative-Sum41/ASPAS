# Story 1.1: Collaborative Multi-Agent Architecture Design

**Status:** Draft

## Non-Technical Explanation

Think of this story as creating blueprints for a specialized team of AI experts who will work together on packaging applications. Just like you'd design an office building with different departments, meeting rooms, and communication systems before construction begins, we need to design how our AI team members will be organized, how they'll communicate, and how decisions will be coordinated.

This design will map out which AI experts we need (like an installer analyst, a script writer, and a security specialist), how they'll share information, who makes the final decisions when there's disagreement, and how the whole process flows from start to finish.

## Why This Matters

Without this blueprint, we'd be building pieces of the system that might not fit together properly. By designing the multi-agent architecture first, we ensure all components will work together seamlessly, communicate effectively, and produce consistent results. This is the foundation that everything else will build upon.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As the development team, we need a comprehensive multi-agent system architecture design that enables specialized AI components to work together effectively while handling application packaging tasks.

**Context:** This is the first story in the APAS project, laying the foundation for all subsequent development. It defines the overall system architecture, establishing how different AI agents will communicate and coordinate their activities to automate application packaging workflows.

## Detailed Requirements

- Design a collaborative multi-agent architecture with distinct roles and responsibilities
- Define specialized agents for different aspects of the packaging workflow (installer analysis, script generation, policy creation, etc.)
- Create orchestration layer to coordinate activities and workflow between agents
- Design inter-agent communication protocols and message formats
- Define conflict resolution mechanisms when agents have competing recommendations
- Establish clear boundaries and interfaces between agents
- Document the architecture with diagrams and explanations
- Consider future expansion to more specialized agents and cloud integration

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Architecture documentation includes component diagrams showing all agents and their relationships
- AC2: Communication protocol is clearly defined with message formats and exchange patterns
- AC3: Orchestration layer has well-defined responsibilities and interfaces
- AC4: Architecture addresses all functional requirements from the PRD
- AC5: Architecture design accommodates future enhancements without major refactoring
- AC6: Conflict resolution mechanisms are clearly defined and testable

## Visual Design Reference

The architecture diagram should look similar to this (simplified example):

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  User Interface │     │   Orchestrator  │
└────────┬────────┘     └────────┬────────┘
         │                       │
         ▼                       ▼
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│               Event Bus                │
└─┬─────────────┬─────────────┬─────────┘
  │             │             │
  ▼             ▼             ▼
┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐ ┌─────────┐
│ Installer│ │  PSADT  │ │  WDAC   │
│ Analysis │ │Generator│ │  Agent  │
│  Agent   │ │  Agent  │ │         │
└─────────┘ └─────────┘ └─────────┘
```

The system should follow a modular microkernel architecture with the orchestration core as the central component, specialized agents as loadable modules, and an event bus for communication between components.

## Manual Testing Guide (For Non-Technical Users)

While this is primarily a design document, there are aspects you can verify to ensure the architecture design is complete and sound:

1. **Documentation Review**:
   - Check that the architecture document exists in the specified location
   - Verify that diagrams are clear and understandable
   - Confirm that the document explains the system in terms that are reasonably understandable

2. **Component Verification**:
   - Verify the document includes all six specialized agent types mentioned in the PRD
   - Check that the orchestration core is clearly defined
   - Confirm that communication paths between components are illustrated

3. **Future-Proofing Check**:
   - The document should mention how new agent types can be added in the future
   - Verify that scalability considerations are addressed
   - Confirm that the architecture allows for potential cloud integration later

4. **Expected Results**:
   - The architecture document should be comprehensive but understandable
   - Diagrams should clearly show the relationships between components
   - The document should explain how the system fulfills the requirements in the PRD
   - The overall design should make logical sense even to non-technical stakeholders

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** No specific unit tests required for architecture design document.
- **Integration Tests:** No integration tests at this stage since the focus is on design.
- **Manual Verification:** 
  - Verify that architecture documentation is comprehensive and clearly explains the components and their interactions
  - Ensure all diagrams are correct and readable
  - Confirm that interface definitions match the architectural design
  - Validate that the design addresses all functional requirements from the PRD
  - Check that all specialized agent types are defined with clear responsibilities
  - Verify that conflict resolution mechanisms are well-defined and practical

## AI Dev Agent Implementation Notes

- Use the mediator pattern for the orchestration core implementation
- Leverage asynchronous communication patterns for the event bus design
- Consider using abstract base classes in Python to define agent interfaces
- Pay special attention to creating clear, type-safe interfaces for agent interactions
- Define explicit error handling protocols and recovery mechanisms
- The implementation is primarily a design document, so clarity and completeness are more important than code efficiency
- When creating Mermaid diagrams, balance detail with readability
- Consider creating sequence diagrams to illustrate key workflows

## Implementation Example

Here's an example of how the agent interface might be defined:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from typing import Dict, Any, List, Optional
from pydantic import BaseModel
from datetime import datetime
import uuid

class AgentMessage(BaseModel):
    """Standard message format for inter-agent communication."""
    id: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))
    sender_id: str
    receiver_id: Optional[str] = None  # None means broadcast
    message_type: str
    content: Dict[str, Any]
    correlation_id: Optional[str] = None
    timestamp: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
    priority: int = 1  # 1-5, with 5 being highest

class Agent(ABC):
    """Base interface for all specialized agents."""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def initialize(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Initialize the agent with the given configuration."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def process_message(self, message: AgentMessage) -> List[AgentMessage]:
        """Process an incoming message and return any response messages."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def get_capabilities(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Return the agent's capabilities for discovery."""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def shutdown(self) -> bool:
        """Gracefully shutdown the agent."""
        pass
```
