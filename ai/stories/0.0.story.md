# Story 0.0: System Preparation and Project Initialization

**Status:** Draft

## Non-Technical Explanation

Think of this story as preparing the kitchen before starting to cook. We need to gather all the ingredients (development tools), make sure we have the right utensils (software frameworks), and set up the workspace (development environment) before we can start creating our application packaging system. This preparation ensures everyone uses the same tools and follows the same recipes, making the end result consistent and high-quality.

## Why This Matters

Without proper system preparation, each developer might use different tools or configurations, leading to inconsistent results and "works on my machine" problems. By establishing this foundation first, we ensure a smooth development process, reduce setup time for new team members, and create a reliable basis for the project that minimizes technical issues later.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a technical stakeholder, I need a complete guide for preparing the development and deployment environment for the APAS project, ensuring all necessary tools, repositories, and configurations are properly set up.

**Context:** This is the prerequisite story that must be completed before any actual development begins. It establishes the complete technical foundation for the project, including development tools, source control, deployment pipeline, and testing environment.

## Detailed Requirements

- Create a new GitHub repository for the APAS project with appropriate structure
- Set up development environment requirements for all contributors
- Install and configure necessary development tools and dependencies
- Establish deployment pipeline and environments (development, testing, production)
- Create initial project structure following the architecture document
- Set up testing framework and environment
- Establish code quality and review process
- Document the complete setup process for new contributors
- Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Create access controls and security protocols

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: GitHub repository is created with proper structure and initial README
- AC2: Development environment can be set up by following documentation in less than 2 hours
- AC3: Project structure matches the architecture document
- AC4: CI/CD pipeline is established for automated testing and deployment
- AC5: Code quality tools (linting, formatting) are configured
- AC6: All environments (development, testing, production) are properly configured
- AC7: Security measures for sensitive information are implemented
- AC8: Documentation clearly explains the entire setup process

## Manual Testing Guide (For Non-Technical Users)

While this is primarily a technical setup story, there are still aspects you can verify to ensure proper completion:

1. **Repository Verification**:
   - Visit the GitHub repository URL and confirm it exists
   - Check that the README contains clear project information and setup instructions
   - Verify that the project structure matches the expected layout

2. **Documentation Review**:
   - Review the setup documentation for clarity and completeness
   - Confirm that contribution guidelines are clear
   - Verify that architecture documentation is accessible

3. **Environment Testing**:
   - Ask for a demonstration of the development environment
   - Verify that a sample application can be launched
   - Confirm that automated tests can be run successfully

4. **CI/CD Verification**:
   - Check that CI workflow runs automatically on pull requests
   - Verify that code quality checks are enforced
   - Confirm that deployment process is documented

5. **Expected Results**:
   - All documentation should be clear and comprehensive
   - Setup process should be well-defined and reproducible
   - Code quality standards should be clearly established
   - Repository should be properly structured according to the architecture

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** 
  - No specific unit tests required for repository setup.

- **Integration Tests:** 
  - Test the CI/CD pipeline with a sample commit
  - Verify that linting and formatting work as expected
  - Test database initialization scripts

- **Manual Verification:** 
  - Follow the setup documentation on a clean machine to verify it works as expected
  - Verify all setup scripts run without errors
  - Confirm environment can be set up within the 2-hour timeframe
  - Check that all required tools and dependencies are correctly installed
  - Verify that a new developer can understand and execute the setup process

## AI Dev Agent Implementation Notes

- Focus on creating comprehensive and fool-proof setup scripts that handle potential issues gracefully
- Ensure all documentation is extremely detailed and clear
- Implementation should emphasize reproducibility and consistency across different environments
- Pay special attention to error handling in setup scripts
- Create helpful error messages for common setup issues
- Consider creating a troubleshooting guide for common setup problems
- Ensure all security best practices are followed for secret management

## Implementation Example

Here's an example of how the setup script might be structured:

```powershell
# setup_dev.ps1
# APAS Development Environment Setup Script

Write-Host "APAS Development Environment Setup" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "====================================" -ForegroundColor Cyan

# Check prerequisites
$prerequisites = @{
    "Python" = "python --version";
    "Node.js" = "node --version";
    "Docker" = "docker --version";
    "PowerShell" = "pwsh --version";
    "Git" = "git --version"
}

$missing = @()
foreach ($prereq in $prerequisites.Keys) {
    Write-Host "Checking $prereq... " -NoNewline
    try {
        $result = Invoke-Expression $prerequisites[$prereq] 2>&1
        if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
            Write-Host "Found: $result" -ForegroundColor Green
        } else {
            Write-Host "Not found" -ForegroundColor Red
            $missing += $prereq
        }
    } catch {
        Write-Host "Not found" -ForegroundColor Red
        $missing += $prereq
    }
}

if ($missing.Count -gt 0) {
    Write-Host "`nThe following prerequisites are missing:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    foreach ($item in $missing) {
        Write-Host "- $item" -ForegroundColor Yellow
    }
    Write-Host "`nPlease install the missing prerequisites and run this script again." -ForegroundColor Yellow
    exit 1
}

# Continue with environment setup...
```

   # AI model settings
   MODEL_PATH=./models
   USE_CLOUD_MODELS=False
   MODEL_MEMORY_LIMIT=8

   # Logging settings
   LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

   # File paths
   TEMP_DIR=./tmp
   DATA_DIR=./data
   TEMPLATES_DIR=./data/templates

   # PowerShell settings
   POWERSHELL_PATH=powershell.exe
   PSADT_VERSION=3.9.3
   ```

2. **Frontend Environment Variables**
   - Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api/v1

### 5. Downloading and Setting Up AI Models (Optional)

For local AI model execution:

1. **Create Models Directory**
   ```powershell
   mkdir models
   ```

2. **Download Quantized Models**
   - Download models from Hugging Face:
   ```powershell
   # Example for LLAMA-2-7B (4-bit quantized)
   huggingface-cli download TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGUF llama-2-7b.Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir models/llama-2-7b
   
   # Example for Mistral-7B (4-bit quantized)
   huggingface-cli download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-v0.1-GGUF mistral-7b-v0.1.Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir models/mistral-7b
   
   # Example for MPT-1.3B

   USE_CLOUD_MODELS=False
   EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME=all-MiniLM-L6-v2
   ORCHESTRATOR_MODEL_NAME=mistral-7b
   ```

### 6. Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### 6.1 Python Environment Issues

- **Issue**: Poetry not found in PATH
  - **Solution**: Add Poetry to your PATH: `$env:PATH += ";$env:APPDATA\Python\Scripts"`

- **Issue**: Dependency conflicts
  - **Solution**: Delete poetry.lock and try again: `del poetry.lock && poetry install`

#### 6.2 Supabase Issues

- **Issue**: Docker errors with Supabase
  - **Solution**: Ensure Docker Desktop is running and has sufficient resources

- **Issue**: Database migration errors
  - **Solution**: Reset local database: `supabase db reset`

#### 6.3 Frontend Development Issues

- **Issue**: Node modules conflicts
  - **Solution**: Delete node_modules and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

- **Issue**: TypeScript errors
  - **Solution**: Run type checking separately: `npm run type-check`
