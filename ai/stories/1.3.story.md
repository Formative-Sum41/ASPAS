# Story 1.3: Database Schema Design and Implementation

**Status:** Draft

## Non-Technical Explanation

Think of this story as designing the filing system for our application packaging process. Just like a well-organized office needs proper filing cabinets, folders, and labels to store and find important documents, our system needs a well-designed database to store and retrieve all the information it works with.

We're creating the structure for storing details about application packages, installation scripts, security policies, and how our AI team members communicate with each other. This is like designing labeled drawers for different types of documents, with cross-references so related items can be found together, and an efficient indexing system so information can be retrieved quickly.

## Why This Matters

Without a well-designed database, our system would have no reliable way to store or retrieve the information it needs. It would be like trying to run an office where everyone just piles papers randomly on their desks – chaotic and inefficient. A proper database design ensures that:
1. Information is stored consistently and completely
2. Related data can be connected (like linking a package to its installation script)
3. The system can quickly find the information it needs
4. Data remains valid and reliable over time

This is the foundation for all data storage in the system and affects every other component that needs to save or access information.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a developer, I need a properly designed database schema to store system data including package metadata, agent state, agent communications, and system configuration.

**Context:** Building on the architecture design (Story 1.1) and development environment (Story 1.2), this story focuses on creating the data persistence layer for the APAS system. The database schema will define how all system data is stored, including application packages, agent communications, and system state.

## Detailed Requirements

- Design database schema for storing package metadata
- Create tables for tracking process state and history
- Implement schema for storing system configuration
- Design schema for knowledge base references
- Create schema for agent state tracking and communication logs
- Implement appropriate indexes for performance
- Create database migration scripts
- Document schema design and relationships

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Database schema supports all required data storage needs including multi-agent specifics
- AC2: Schema includes appropriate relationships between entities
- AC3: Performance testing shows acceptable query response times
- AC4: Migration scripts successfully initialize the database
- AC5: Schema documentation clearly explains the design decisions
- AC6: Agent communication logs can be stored and queried efficiently

## Visual Design Reference

The database schema will include several interconnected tables, similar to this simplified entity-relationship diagram:

## Manual Testing Guide (For Non-Technical Users)

While database schema design is highly technical, there are still aspects you can verify to ensure the work is complete and meets requirements:

1. **Documentation Review**:
   - Check that the database schema documentation exists and includes clear diagrams
   - Verify that all main entities from the PRD are represented in the schema (packages, installers, scripts, policies, etc.)
   - Confirm that the documentation explains each table's purpose in non-technical terms
   - Check that the relationships between tables are explained (e.g., how a package connects to its installation script)

2. **Functionality Demonstration**:
   - Ask a developer to demonstrate storing and retrieving a sample package
   - Verify that all related components (installer, script, policy) are properly linked
   - Ask to see how agent communication is logged and retrieved

3. **Performance Check**:
   - Request a demonstration of how quickly the system can retrieve data
   - Ask to see the results of performance testing with multiple records

4. **Expected Results**:
   - The database should store all required information for the system
   - Relationships between entities should be logical and well-defined
   - Performance should be acceptable even with many records
   - Documentation should clearly explain the schema design

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** 
  - Write tests for SQLAlchemy model validation
  - Test database session management
  - Verify relationship navigation between models

- **Integration Tests:** 
  - Test migration scripts on a clean database
  - Verify data persistence across application restarts
  - Test complex queries spanning multiple tables
  - Validate that vector similarity search works correctly

- **Manual Verification:** 
  - Review database schema documentation for clarity
  - Verify that all required entities from the data model document are implemented
  - Check that migration scripts run without errors
  - Confirm that seed data is properly loaded
  - Verify that database performance meets requirements for common operations

## AI Dev Agent Implementation Notes

- Focus on creating a normalized database schema that minimizes redundancy
- Implement proper indexes to support the most common query patterns
- Consider using PostgreSQL-specific features like JSONB for flexible metadata storage
- When implementing the vector storage for knowledge items, ensure the vector dimensions match the embedding model being used
- Pay careful attention to implementing efficient correlation tracking for event logs
- Consider implementing soft deletion for entities that might need to be restored
- The SQLAlchemy models should include proper type hints and validation
- Create appropriate database constraints to ensure data integrity (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, etc.)
- Add informative comments to migration scripts to explain the purpose of each change

## Implementation Example

Here's an example of how the Package SQLAlchemy model might be implemented:

```python
from sqlalchemy import Column, String, DateTime, Integer, ForeignKey, JSON, Boolean, Text, Enum
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.sql import func
import enum
import uuid

Base = declarative_base()

class PackageStatus(enum.Enum):
    DRAFT = "draft"
    ANALYZING = "analyzing"
    GENERATING_SCRIPT = "generating_script"
    CREATING_POLICY = "creating_policy"
    TESTING = "testing"
    WAITING_APPROVAL = "waiting_approval"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
    FAILED = "failed"

class Package(Base):
    """
    Represents a complete application package, including all associated 
    artifacts and metadata.
    """
    __tablename__ = "packages"
    
    id = Column(String, primary_key=True, default=lambda: str(uuid.uuid4()))
    name = Column(String(255), nullable=False)
    version = Column(String(50), nullable=False)
    publisher = Column(String(255), nullable=False)
    description = Column(Text)
    status = Column(Enum(PackageStatus), nullable=False, default=PackageStatus.DRAFT)
    created_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now())
    updated_at = Column(DateTime(timezone=True), server_default=func.now(), onupdate=func.now())
    
    # Foreign keys to related components
    installer_id = Column(String, ForeignKey("installers.id"))
    psadt_script_id = Column(String, ForeignKey("psadt_scripts.id"))
    wdac_policy_id = Column(String, ForeignKey("wdac_policies.id"))
    documentation_id = Column(String, ForeignKey("documentation.id"))
    
    # Additional metadata stored as JSON
    metadata = Column(JSON, default={})
    tags = Column(JSON, default=[])
    
    # Relationships
    installer = relationship("Installer", back_populates="package")
    psadt_script = relationship("PSADTScript", back_populates="package")
    wdac_policy = relationship("WDACPolicy", back_populates="package")
    documentation = relationship("Documentation", back_populates="package")
    events = relationship("Event", back_populates="package")
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"<Package {self.name} v{self.version}>"
```
