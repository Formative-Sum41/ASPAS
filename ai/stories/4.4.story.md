# Story 4.4: WDAC Policy Refinement

**Status:** Draft

## Non-Technical Explanation

This story focuses on creating a system that automatically improves security policies based on testing results. Think of it like having an architect who can modify building plans after walking through a prototype to fix any issues discovered during the walkthrough.

When we test Windows Defender Application Control (WDAC) policies in audit mode (Story 4.3), we discover legitimate application components that would be blocked if the policy were enforced. This feature analyzes those potential blocks, called "code integrity violations," and automatically adds appropriate rules to allow those legitimate components.

The system examines each violation, determines what type of rule would be most appropriate (publisher rule, file hash rule, or path rule), and adds it to the policy. This iterative refinement process ensures the final policy will allow all required application functionality while maintaining the strongest possible security posture.

## Why This Matters

Automatic policy refinement is essential for several reasons:

1. **Completeness**: Ensures policies cover all legitimate application components, preventing application failures.

2. **Efficiency**: Automates what would otherwise be a tedious manual process of identifying and addressing policy gaps.

3. **Optimization**: Intelligently chooses the most appropriate rule types based on file characteristics.

4. **Risk Reduction**: Minimizes the chance of deployment issues by addressing gaps before enforcement.

5. **Time Savings**: Reduces what could be hours of manual policy editing to minutes of automated processing.

Without automated policy refinement, organizations would need to manually analyze audit logs and modify policies, a time-consuming and error-prone process that often leads to either overly permissive policies or application failures.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a packaging engineer, I need the system to automatically refine WDAC policies based on audit testing results.

**Context:** Building on the audit mode testing capability (Story 4.3), this story adds automatic policy refinement to address identified gaps. This capability connects testing results to policy improvements, creating an iterative refinement process that results in accurate, comprehensive policies.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement analysis of code integrity violations
- Create policy adjustments based on audit results
- Develop iterative testing and refinement

- Document refinement methodology and limitations

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: System correctly analyzes code integrity violations
- AC2: Policy adjustments address identified issues
- AC3: Iterative refinement eliminates false positives
- AC4: Categorization provides context for policy additions
- AC5: Documentation explains refinement decisions

## Manual Testing Guide (For Non-Technical Users)

You can verify the WDAC Policy Refinement is working correctly through these checks:

1. **Basic Refinement Flow**:
   - Upload an application installer
   - Generate a WDAC policy
   - Run an audit mode test (from Story 4.3)
   - When gaps are found, use the "Refine Policy" option
   - Verify that a new policy version is created
   - Check that each identified gap has been addressed with appropriate rules

2. **Rule Type Verification**:
   - For a refinement that added rules, examine the rule details
   - Verify that signed files received publisher rules
   - Check that unsigned files received hash or path rules
   - Confirm that rule types match the system's explanation of why each rule was chosen

3. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - After an initial refinement, run another audit test
   - Verify that the number of gaps decreases
   - Continue refinement until no gaps remain
   - Check that the final policy allows all legitimate application functionality

4. **Expected Results**:
   - Each refinement should add rules that address specific gaps
   - The refinement report should clearly explain what rules were added and why
   - The number of gaps should decrease with each refinement iteration
   - The final policy should allow all legitimate application functionality
   - The policy should maintain a strong security posture, using the most appropriate rule types

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:** 
  - Test event analysis logic
  - Verify rule generation for different file types
  - Test policy modification
  - Validate rule optimization
  - Test iterative refinement workflow

- **Integration Tests:** 
  - Test end-to-end refinement process
  - Verify policy modification and testing
  - Test with various application types
  - Validate handling of complex rule scenarios
  - Test error handling and recovery

- **Manual Verification:** 
  - Test with real application installers
  - Verify rule creation against file properties
  - Check policy effect on application functionality
  - Validate report clarity and usefulness
  - Test with applications of varying complexity
