# Story 5.8: Feedback Collection and Impact Visualization

**Status:** Draft

## Non-Technical Explanation

This story focuses on creating a system that collects feedback from packaging engineers about AI decisions and shows them how their feedback influences the system's future behavior.

Imagine you have a personal assistant who helps manage your schedule. If you provide feedback that they're not allocating enough buffer time between meetings, you'd want to see how they've incorporated that feedback and adjusted their scheduling approach. This creates a productive learning relationship where your assistant continuously improves based on your input.

Similarly, our feedback collection and impact visualization feature will allow packaging engineers to provide specific feedback on the AI's decisions and then see exactly how that feedback shapes future behavior. For example, if an engineer provides feedback that a certain installer type should be handled differently, the system will show how that feedback is incorporated into its decision model and how it affects similar cases in the future.

This visualization will make the system's learning process transparent, showing engineers how their expertise is being used to improve the automation. It creates a collaborative relationship where the human's knowledge continuously enhances the system, while the system's learning becomes increasingly aligned with the organization's specific needs and preferences.

This feedback loop ensures that the automation system doesn't remain static but continuously improves over time based on real-world usage and expert guidance.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a packaging engineer, I need to provide feedback on AI decisions and see how my feedback impacts future system behavior.

**Context:** This story builds on all previous components in Epic 5 (Stories 5.1-5.7) to create a comprehensive feedback collection system with impact visualization. This completes the human oversight interface by creating a clear feedback loop where engineers can provide guidance and see how it influences future automation.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement feedback collection at key decision points
- Create structured feedback forms with decision context references
- Develop visualization of how feedback modifies future decision trees
- Implement tracking of feedback impact across multiple packaging jobs
- Create visualizations showing system learning over time
- Document feedback utilization and how it shapes future decisions

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Feedback collection is integrated at appropriate decision points
- AC2: Forms collect relevant information with clear decision context
- AC3: Visualization shows how feedback influences future decisions
- AC4: Tracking clearly illustrates feedback impact across packaging jobs
- AC5: Learning visualizations effectively communicate system improvement

## Manual Testing Guide (For Non-Technical Users)

You can verify the feedback collection and impact visualization features through these steps:

1. **Providing Feedback on Decisions**:
   - Open the application and navigate to the Dashboard
   - Select a task with completed processing
   - Navigate to the decision visualization
   - Find a decision point where you want to provide feedback
   - Look for the feedback trigger (usually an icon or button near the decision)
   - Click the feedback trigger to open the feedback form
   - Try providing different types of feedback (correction, preference, suggestion)
   - Submit your feedback
   - Verify that the system acknowledges your submission

2. **Viewing Feedback Impact**:
   - After submitting feedback, look for an option to view the impact
   - Alternatively, navigate to the feedback history and select your feedback
   - Check that you can see a visualization of how your feedback affects decisions
   - Verify that the before/after comparison clearly shows the changes
   - Look for information about where and when your feedback has been applied
   - Check that impact metrics are provided

3. **Exploring Learning Progress**:
   - Navigate to the learning tracker or feedback dashboard
   - Look for visualizations showing your feedback contribution
   - Check that you can see how feedback has improved system performance over time
   - Try filtering or exploring different components to see impact by area
   - Verify that the learning timeline shows progression

4. **Reviewing Feedback History**:
   - Navigate to the feedback history view
   - Check that you can see a list of your previous feedback
   - Verify that each feedback item shows its status (submitted, processed, implemented, rejected)
   - Select a feedback item to view details
   - Check that you can see the original context and your feedback
   - Verify that implementation details are provided for processed feedback

5. **Testing Different Feedback Types**:
   - Try providing different types of feedback:
     - Correction (fixing an incorrect decision)
     - Preference (indicating your preferred approach)
     - Suggestion (offering an improvement idea)
     - Rating (if available, rating a decision or process)
   - Verify that each type provides appropriate context and controls
   - Check that the impact visualization is appropriate for each type
