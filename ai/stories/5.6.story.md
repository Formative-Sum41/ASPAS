# Story 5.6: Manual Intervention Controls

**Status:** Draft

## Non-Technical Explanation

This story focuses on creating the controls that allow packaging engineers to step in and guide the automation system when needed. 

Imagine you're using a GPS navigation system that can usually drive your car automatically, but occasionally it encounters a situation it's not confident aboutâ€”like an unmarked construction zone or an unusual intersection. In those cases, the system would alert you, explain why it's uncertain, and ask for your guidance before proceeding.

Similarly, our manual intervention controls create specific points in the automated packaging process where human expertise can be applied. The system will identify situations where it lacks confidence or where human judgment would be valuable, pause the process, and present the situation with clear context about what's happening and why intervention might be necessary.

For example, if the system is uncertain about the correct installation parameters for an unusual installer, it might pause, show you its analysis so far, explain why it's uncertain, and present options for how to proceed. You'll be able to see how your intervention will impact the rest of the process, with the system showing you the predicted outcomes of different choices.

These intervention controls ensure that human expertise is applied precisely where it's most valuable, while still allowing automation to handle the routine aspects of packaging. This creates an effective partnership between human engineers and the AI system.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a packaging engineer, I need to intervene in automated processes with clear understanding of decision context and impact.

**Context:** Building on the process monitoring interface (Story 5.5) and decision visualization components (Stories 5.2-5.4), this story implements the controls and interfaces that allow packaging engineers to intervene in the automated process when necessary. This creates an effective human-in-the-loop system where automation handles routine tasks but human expertise can be applied precisely where needed.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement identification of intervention points with decision context
- Create intervention interfaces with explanation of why intervention is needed
- Develop guidance for intervention decisions with predicted outcomes

- Create documentation of intervention impact with before/after comparison
- Document intervention capabilities and best practices

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: System correctly identifies situations requiring intervention with clear explanations
- AC2: Interfaces provide appropriate controls with context for each intervention type
- AC3: Guidance helps engineers make informed decisions with predictive visualization
- AC4: Tracking maintains record of all interventions with decision context
- AC5: Documentation clearly shows impact of interventions with visual comparison

## Manual Testing Guide (For Non-Technical Users)

You can verify the manual intervention controls through these steps:

1. **Receiving Intervention Notifications**:
   - Start or monitor an active packaging task
   - Wait for an intervention notification or trigger one (if test controls are available)
   - Verify that you receive a clear notification when intervention is needed
   - Check that the notification includes priority information and context summary
   - Confirm that clicking the notification takes you to the intervention panel

2. **Using the Intervention Panel**:
   - Open the intervention panel from a notification or from the task monitoring view
   - Verify that the panel clearly explains why intervention is needed
   - Check that you can see the context information relevant to the decision
   - Try viewing different option details if multiple options are available
   - For parameter adjustments, try changing parameters and see if validation works correctly

3. **Exploring Impact Visualization**:
   - When viewing intervention options, check that impact visualization is available
   - Try selecting different options to see how the impact visualization changes
   - Verify that the before/after comparison clearly shows differences
   - Check that risk assessments are provided for different options
   - For parameter adjustments, try changing values to see how it affects the predicted impact

4. **Making and Submitting Decisions**:
   - Select an option or adjust parameters based on your judgment
   - Add notes explaining your decision if that feature is available
   - Submit your decision using the appropriate controls
   - Verify that the system acknowledges your decision
   - Check that the process continues after your intervention

5. **Viewing Intervention History**:
   - Navigate to the intervention history view
   - Look for your recent intervention in the history list
   - Select the intervention to view details
   - Verify that the history shows what decision was made and why
   - Check that impact summary information is available

6. **Testing Different Intervention Types**:
   - If possible, try to test different types of interventions:
     - Simple approval (yes/no decision)
     - Option selection (choosing from multiple options)
     - Parameter adjustment (changing configuration values)
     - Error handling (responding to an error condition)
   - Verify that each type provides appropriate context and controls

## Testing Requirements

**Guidance:** Verify implementation against the ACs using the following tests.

- **Unit Tests:**
