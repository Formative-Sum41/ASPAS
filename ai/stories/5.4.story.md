# Story 5.4: Historical Pattern Comparison

**Status:** Draft

## Non-Technical Explanation

This story is about giving packaging engineers the ability to compare current packaging tasks with similar past cases, helping them understand patterns and put current work in context.

Imagine you're a doctor examining a patient. Having access to similar past cases would be incredibly valuableâ€”you could see what symptoms were similar, what treatments worked, and how those patients progressed. This historical context would help you make better-informed decisions about the current patient.

Similarly, our historical pattern comparison feature will show packaging engineers how the current application relates to previously packaged applications. Engineers will be able to see side-by-side comparisons showing similarities and differences between the current application and similar past ones. For example, they might see that the current application has installation characteristics similar to three previous applications and how the packaging approaches used for those applications might be relevant.

The system will also show how packaging approaches have evolved over time for similar types of applications, helping engineers understand long-term trends and improvements. This historical context helps engineers leverage past experience, identify potential issues based on historical patterns, and make more informed decisions about the current packaging task.

## Goal & Context

**User Story:** As a packaging engineer, I need to compare current packaging processes with similar historical cases to understand patterns and context.

**Context:** Building on the dashboard and visualization components from previous stories (5.1-5.3), this story adds the ability to compare current packaging tasks with similar historical cases. This feature provides valuable context by showing how similar applications were packaged in the past and how packaging approaches have evolved over time.

## Detailed Requirements

- Implement side-by-side visual comparison with similar historical packaging jobs
- Create pattern matching visualization to highlight similarities and differences
- Develop temporal view showing evolution of packaging approaches over time
- Implement filtering for different comparison criteria
- Create metrics for similarity scoring
- Document comparison methodology and interpretation

## Acceptance Criteria (ACs)

- AC1: Comparisons accurately identify genuinely similar cases
- AC2: Visualization clearly highlights relevant similarities and differences
- AC3: Temporal view effectively shows evolution of approaches
- AC4: Filtering provides useful ways to explore different comparison dimensions
- AC5: Similarity metrics correlate with actual relevance to current case
